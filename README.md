## Description
SmartAutomation (smauto) is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that enables users to program complex 
automation scenarios, for connected IoT devices, that go beyond simple automation rules. 
The language is built using Python and TextX and follows the model interpretation paradigm.

This repository includes the language definition among with the interpreter.

Furthermore, below you can find useful side-projects, such as a command-line
interface and a server implementation, which exposes a REST API for remote
validation and interpretation of smauto models.
